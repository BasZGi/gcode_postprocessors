# What it is

This is a script that adds "texture" (thanks to temperature gradients), so as to get horizontal stripes that "look like wood". 

More pictures and how it works is described on [this blog post](http://www.tridimake.com/2012/10/shades-of-brown-with-wood-filament-via.html) and on the [Thingiverse web page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:49276) (best place for a description).

# How to

## As a standalone script

More interestingly, it also works as a standalone Python script (it no more needs Cura nor Skeinforge), which trick is documented [here](http://betterprinter.blogspot.fr/2013/02/how-tun-run-python-cura-plugin-without.html)

You'll need Python 2.7 on your computer. I was told it may have some issues with Unicode and Python 3.

## As a plugin for Cura

Move the .py file to the plugin folder. Ultimaker does not tell which one really, but look with your file manager for a folder named ```plugins``` or for a plugin which is shipped by default (e.g. ```TweakAtZ.py```). Then simply copy/paste this file alongside, and restart Cura.
Actually, it was an official plugin in Cura (from version 12.11+). But the support for Cura plugins at Ultimaker was destroyed during a change to their website years ago, and it never was restored (why?!).

## As a web service

There is also a very limited web service hosted [here](https://www.tecrd.com/page/liens/stl_wood), but it will often refuse your file because it is too big, or because the server is busy doing something else.

### Options


```
python wood.py --min minTemp --max maxTemp --grain grainSize --file gcodeFile
```

See the source code or the [Thingiverse web page](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:49276) for more.

Initial temperature settings will be overridden by the varying pattern that is generated by this script (a variant of recursive Perlin noise). You can run it multiple times to test different values and generated temperature curve until you like it.  

Higher themperature give darker bands (due to the wood being burnt). Do not let the wood stay too long in your nozzle else you will most probably clog it with carbon!  

### Ascii art curve

The script adds a vertical ascii-art "curve" at the end of the file, such as the excerpt show below.
It shows the variations of temperature according to the Z height, so you can get an idea of the effect of the parameters without having to print the object.

# Bugs and caveat

Bug: some people reported UTF8 issues when running Python3 on Windows. Do not run Python3 or better, do not run Windows and you will be good :-D More seriously I may fix the bug one day, but I really want to be compatible with both versions of windows (ref.: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10971033/backporting-python-3-openencoding-utf-8-to-python-2 )
